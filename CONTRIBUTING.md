Branch naming convention:

- `fix/...` → for bug fixes
- `feature/...` → for new features
- `chore/...` → for tooling/docs changes

## ✅ Commit Messages

Follow this format:

```
<type>(scope): short description
```

Example:

```
fix(ui): adjust padding on mobile
feature(blog): add fallback UI
```

Types: `fix`, `feature`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`

1. Push your branch to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin fix/favicon
    ```

2. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `dev` branch of the main repo.

3. Make sure your PR includes:
    - A short description of your changes
    - Screenshots/GIFs if it’s a UI fix
